# Homework 1: Introduction to Python. The Basics


# Part 1 Put strings in variables and print them
word1 = "All"
word2 = "work"
word3 = "and"
word4 = "no"
word5 = "play"
word6 = "make"

# Part 2: Basic math operations
result = 6 * (1 - 2) 
print(result)

# Part 3 Basic math operations with variables
bruce = 6

# Part 4: Calculate compound interest
P = 10000
n = 12
r = 0.08

t = int(input("Enter the number of years the money will be compounded for: "))

A = P * (1 + r/n)**(n*t) # Wait a minute this formula looks familar, I learned that in MAC1105!!

print(f"The final amount after {t} years is: ${A:.2f}") # I hope this is right, I don't know if I did it right



# Part 5: Evaluate numerical expressions

print(5 % 2) # 1
print(9 % 5) # 4
print(15 % 12) # 3
print(12 % 15) # 12
